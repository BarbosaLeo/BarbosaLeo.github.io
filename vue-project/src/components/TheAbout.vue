    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I hold a degree in Game Design, driven by a longstanding passion for creating and developing games. 
        During my studies, I gained practical experience as a Designer Intern at Creative Drive, where I honed my skills 
        in 3D texturing and modeling.
    ​</p><br/>
    <p> Subsequently, I shifted my focus towards game programming, developing a range of simple projects using
        various methods and tools. 
        Most recently, I have expanded my expertise by studying Java development for desktop applications.​
